## 🚀 What to Do Next

### Option 1: Test Locally (Recommended First Step)

**Time: 10 minutes**

1. **Install Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Install Frontend** (new terminal)
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Visit** `http://localhost:3000`

4. **Test the app**
   - Complete a scenario
   - See if grading works
   - Check the UI and timeline
   - Try topic toggle (scenarios with multiple topics)

**Note:** Email won't work locally without SendGrid API key, but that's okay for testing!

---

### Option 2: Deploy to Vercel (For Students to Access)

**Time: 15-20 minutes**

**Prerequisites:**
- GitHub account (free)
- Vercel account (free) - [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- SendGrid account (free tier) - [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)

**Follow [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.**

**Quick version:**

1. **Get SendGrid API Key**
   - Sign up at sendgrid.com
   - Create API key
   - Save it (you'll only see it once!)

2. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/yanivfox/Desktop/AI Initiatives/Primary sources"
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Primary Source Trainer"
   # Create repo on GitHub, then:
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to vercel.com/new
   - Import your GitHub repo
   - Deploy frontend (root: `frontend`)
   - Deploy backend (root: `backend`)
   - Set environment variables:
     - Backend: `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `INSTRUCTOR_EMAIL`
     - Frontend: `VITE_API_URL` (your backend URL)

4. **Share URL with students!**
   - You'll get something like: `https://primary-sources.vercel.app`

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before sharing with students, test these:

- [ ] Load all 10 scenarios
- [ ] Classify sources (primary/secondary/depends)
- [ ] Add justifications
- [ ] Submit and see grading
- [ ] Toggle topics (scenarios 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 have multiple topics)
- [ ] Complete all 10 scenarios
- [ ] Submit final results
- [ ] Receive email at foxyaniv@gmail.com

---

## 📧 Email Setup Notes

**SendGrid Free Tier:**
- 100 emails/day (plenty for a class!)
- Requires email verification
- Takes ~5 minutes to set up

**What emails look like:**
- Formatted HTML with your color scheme
- Student name and timestamp
- Overall score and percentage
- Breakdown by scenario
- Individual source classifications

**If you want to test email locally:**
1. Get SendGrid API key
2. Add to `backend/.env`:
   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_key_here
   INSTRUCTOR_EMAIL=foxyaniv@gmail.com
   ```
3. Restart backend server

## 🎓 Using with Students

### Before Class
1. Deploy to Vercel (or run locally and share via ngrok/similar)
2. Share the URL with students
3. Give them the instructions (in app or separately)

### Instructions for Students

> **Primary Source Trainer Exercise**
>
> 1. Visit: [YOUR_URL_HERE]
> 2. Complete all 10 historical scenarios
> 3. For each source, classify it as Primary, Secondary, or Depends on Topic
> 4. Explain your reasoning (use terms like "closest extant," "mediation," "transmission")
> 5. After completing all 10, click "Finish & Send to Instructor"
> 6. Enter your name and email
>
> **Tips:**
> - Read source descriptions carefully
> - Consider distance from the event (mediation depth)
> - Remember: lost sources can't be primary!
> - Some sources change classification based on topic
>
> **Time:** ~30-45 minutes

### After Students Complete

You'll receive emails at foxyaniv@gmail.com with:
- Who completed it and when
- Their overall score
- Which scenarios they struggled with
- Common mistakes (helps you address in class!)

## 🔧 Customization Ideas (Optional)

Want to modify the app? Here are easy changes:

### Add More Scenarios
Edit `backend/scenarios.py` and add a new function like `generate_scenario_11()`

### Change Colors
Edit `frontend/src/styles/App.css` - change the `:root` CSS variables

### Adjust Grading
Edit `backend/grading.py` - change point values or keyword bonuses

### Change Number of Scenarios
Edit `frontend/src/App.jsx` - the app is designed for 10, but you can change this

### Add Images
Add `image_url` to events in scenarios, and the timeline will display them

## 🆘 If You Need Help

1. **Local testing issues:** Check [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
2. **Deployment issues:** Check [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)
3. **Understanding features:** Check [Primary_Source_Trainer_PRD.md](Primary_Source_Trainer_PRD.md)
4. **Code questions:** All files are well-commented

**Common Issues:**

- **Backend won't start:** Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed and venv is activated
- **Frontend won't start:** Make sure Node 18+ is installed, try deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling
- **Can't connect:** Make sure both servers are running (backend on :8000, frontend on :3000)
- **Email not working:** Check SendGrid API key is set correctly in `.env`

---

## 🎉 You're Ready!

The app is complete and ready to use. Your students will learn:
- What makes a source "primary" vs "secondary"
- How to evaluate mediation and transmission
- That classification depends on research question
- How to justify their reasoning

**Good luck with your class!** The app is designed to be intuitive, but students should spend 30-45 minutes to complete thoughtfully.
